    <p>Dear Dr. Mudasar,</p>     

    <p>
        I Hope this letter finds you well. I am Writing to express my growing concern about security measures <br>
        currently in place at our college. As a dedicated student, I deeply value the safe and supportive environment that our <br> 
        institution strives to provide. However, recent incidents on campus have caused signifacnt apprehensions among the <br> 
        student body regarding our over all security.
    </p>

    <p>
        Over the past few weeks, there have been reports of unothorized individuals gaining acces to our campus facilities. <br> 
        Additionally, several students, including myself, have observed areas around the campus where lighting is inadequate, <br>
        making these spots potentially dangerous during the evening hours. These issues have understandably led to a heightened <br>
        sense of vulnerability among students.
    </p>

    <p>
        I kindly request a meeting with you or the appropriate security personnel to discuss these concerns and potential solutions <br>
        further. I am confident that, together, we can create a more secure and reassuring environment for evryone at college.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.
    </p> 
    <br>
    <p>
        Yours Sincerely, <br>
        Ahmad Anas Farani, <br>
